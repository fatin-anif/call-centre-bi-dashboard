Queue-level and Agent-level performance

Forecast vs Actual call volume

**Tools & Techniques Used**

Excel Power Query — data cleaning & transformation

Excel Data Model — relationships across 4 tables

Power Pivot Measures — AVERAGE(), DIVIDE(), COUNTROWS() etc.

PivotTables & PivotCharts — KPIs, trend analysis, queue insights

Interactive Slicers — filter by Queue, AgentID, Date, Abandoned

Dashboard Design — clean layout, KPIs, charts, filters

)

Total Calls := COUNTROWS(Calls)
